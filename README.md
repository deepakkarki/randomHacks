# randomHacks
Random hacks for me to try. Basically an assorted collection of mini-projects.

Many a times I have various crazy ideas I want to try, things that'll be nothing more than a hack. Proof of concept demos, most of them won't take more than a week of my time. 

I don't want to create a seperate repository for each and every one of my hacks, so this. Most of the projects are for learning purposes and would involve rewriting existing technologies. So do feel free to play with the code if you want to learn, but just don't take them seriously!

##1. Python event loop
Try to emulate the Node.js event loop in python. Make all I/O interaction non blocking and file related operations take a callback function.

##2. API for hackster.io
A Node.JS api for accessing contents on Hackster.io. This should be accompanied by an ionic based mobile app.

##3. A WebRTC based P2P video chatting application
I have wanted to play with WebRTC and video streaming for a long time. What better way than to try it with this hack!
