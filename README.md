# randomHacks
Random hacks for me to try. Basically an assorted collection of mini-projects.

Many a times I have various crazy ideas I want to try, things that'll be nothing more than a hack. Proof of concept demos, most of them won't take more than a week of my time. 

I don't want to create a seperate repository for each and every one of my hacks, so this. Most of the projects are for learning purposes and would involve rewriting existing technologies. So do feel free to play with the code if you want to learn, but just don't take them seriously!
